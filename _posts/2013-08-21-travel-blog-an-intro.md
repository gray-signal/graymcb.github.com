Should be more content coming in soon, but here's a quick intro. At least to the trvel blog bit. As you can see from the title bar there, this is called gray-noise. It'll be mostly signal.

I have a [tumblr called gray-signal][tu], which is mostly noise. It's a joke, see?

I went on a nine day trip to Paris and London, from the 8th of August this year to the 17th. And I posted pictures along the way, but I took many more. And I wrote in a journal every day. I wanted to show off my trip in an interesting way, but none of the services I use ([twitter][tw], [tumblr][tu], [youtube][yt], facebook, flickr, etc.) really fit what I was looking for. So a blog. And my own blog, not on some service.

So expect Day One: Departure soon enough. If you're reading this in the future, then it'll be linked from here.
