The first day started off... interestingly. I wasn't going to spring for a cab, and I had no one to drive me. Plus I was making the trip alone. The flight was at 1:30pm, and from what I could tell, the bus ride there from the city would take about one and a half to two hours. I wanted to be an hour or so early, just in case. Add that all up, and you get a home-departure time of around 10:30. Well, the airport bus only leaves so often, so I was leaving home at 10am.

So then I thought... _Well, I'm making a transfer at different stops, so what if I miss the connection?_ And that's how I ended up at the airport at around ten in the morning (the bus didn't take nearly as long as I had thought), three and a half hours early for my flight. Too early even to check in.

But that's not all bad. Relaxing even. I got to take a rest and collect myself before the flight too off. Better earlier than later.

I was on twitter polling for suggestions on what to do with myself, and I briefly considered taking in a quick drink.
