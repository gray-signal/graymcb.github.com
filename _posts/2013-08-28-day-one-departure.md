### Departure ###
The first day started off... interestingly. I wasn't going to spring for a cab, and I had no one to drive me. Plus I was making the trip alone. The flight was at 1:30pm, and from what I could tell, the bus ride there from the city would take about one and a half to two hours. I wanted to be an hour or so early, just in case. Add that all up, and you get a home-departure time of around 10:30. Well, the airport bus only leaves so often, so I was leaving home at 10am.

So then I thought... _Well, I'm making a transfer at different stops, so what if I miss the connection?_ And that's how I ended up at the airport at around ten in the morning (the bus didn't take nearly as long as I had thought), three and a half hours early for my flight. Too early even to check in.

But that's not all bad. Relaxing even. I got to take a rest and collect myself before the flight too off. Better earlier than later.

I was on twitter polling for suggestions on what to do with myself, and I briefly considered taking in a quick drink.

-- but I thought better of it, at the time, and after reading for a bit, I got through security.

Once you've seen one plane-window-shot, you've seen all of them. There's not much range to the format. But I like this one. Blue and white, the only things there are.

The next stop was Philadelphia, and from there a connecting flight to Paris. If you don't know much about air travel or maps, then this seems fairly reasonable. And it probably is a fairly reasonable itinerary regardless.

But if you know what a [Great Circle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle) route is, then you can see that from Philly airport, I would pass right back over the Maritimes, from where I started the trip. Silly, but what are you gonna do?

### Arrival ### 

I slept on the flight. Not sure how long it was, but it was on and off. When we arrived in Paris, it was 8am local time.

The thing about CDG airport is that it's on the outskirts of the city. And that there's no easy, free wifi with good signal. So after struggling to check in that I was still alive, I bought a ticket, and got on the train into the city center.

That first experience with train transport involved an accoridian player and some rough english from someone trying to give directions.
